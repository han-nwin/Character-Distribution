act scene 

venice a street

enter antonio salarino and salanio

antonio

in sooth i know not why i am so sad
it wearies me you say it wearies you
but how i caught it found it or came by it
what stuff tis made of whereof it is born
i am to learn
and such a wantwit sadness makes of me
that i have much ado to know myself

salarino

your mind is tossing on the ocean
there where your argosies with portly sail
like signiors and rich burghers on the flood
or as it were the pageants of the sea
do overpeer the petty traffickers
that curtsy to them do them reverence
as they fly by them with their woven wings

salanio

believe me sir had i such venture forth
the better part of my affections would
be with my hopes abroad i should be still
plucking the grass to know where sits the wind
peering in maps for ports and piers and roads
and every object that might make me fear
misfortune to my ventures out of doubt
would make me sad
