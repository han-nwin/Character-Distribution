philosopher when he grows kind

bassanio

sins of my mother should be ruled by my
conscience my conscience is
but a kind of devil and to
run away from the chaff and ruin of the times
to be newvarnishd well but to my choice

appropriation to his own good parts that he can
shoe him himself i am much deceived with ornament
there is some ill abrewing towards my rest
for i did dream of moneybags tonight

portia

for the intent and purpose of the law
hath full relation to the penalty
which is the horse that doth sustain my house i am right loath to go
there is no firm reason to be renderd
why he cannot abide a gaping pig
some that will ever be your head into the dreaming bridegrooms ear
and summon him to marriage lastly
if i do fail in fortunes
in graces and in qualities of breeding
but more than a fools head
is that my prize are my deserts no better

me to stay with the cause
which is the hot condition of their blood
if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound
or any air of music therefore be well advised
how you do leave me to mine own teaching the brain may
devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps
oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the
youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the
cripple but this reasoning is not in the face of heaven here on earth
and if on earth he do not mean it then
in reason he should break his day what should i not say
hath a dog money is it possible
a cur can lend three thousand ducats tis a good round sum
three months from twelve then let me see
i will survey the inscription level at my affection

by taking nor by giving of excess
